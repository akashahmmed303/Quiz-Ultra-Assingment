            #1 What is the purpose of React Router?
          </h2>
          <p className='mt-5 text-gray-800'>
            We use react-router to navigate different pages in our react app. We
            can render different components based on different routes in the
            URL. We can also fetch data for a specific route and pass them in
            the component then we can show them in the UI. By using react-router
            page wonâ€™t refresh when we go a different route every time.

            #2 How does context API work?
          </h2>
          <p className='mt-5 text-gray-800'>
            Context API provides a way to pass data in the component tree
            without passing any props at each level. This way we can avoid props
            drilling. And we can pass any data, any function to any child
            component I mean in any component in the tree. The data provided by
            context is global. Any component in the tree can get the data. We
            can create a new context by using React.createContext and then we
            can wrap our component tree by using Context.Provider with value
            property. Then we can get the value anywhere in the component tree
            and use it.

          <h2 className='text-3xl font-semibold '> #3 Explain useRef hook?</h2>
          <p className='mt-5 text-gray-800'>
            When we need to get a reference of a DOM element we use the useRef
            hook. To get a dom element and to manipulate it we need to get the
            element first, in react we can get this reference by using useRef
            hook. useRef returns an object. In the object, there will be a
            current property where the reference is stored. We can also use it
            as a variable like a state. But the difference is the component will
            not render when its value changes.
